This project deals with the INDECS dataset 

 The database consists of several sets of pictures taken in five rooms of different functionality under various illumination and weather conditions at different periods of time. Each room was observed from many viewpoints and angles. Moreover, the normal activity in the rooms was recorded: people appear in the rooms, pieces of furniture are moved over time. 
 
 
 
 The following are the accuracy plots which were generated using the Optimized CNN curves. The report is attached in the src section.
